10.1007/s10140-020-01886-y,33523309,,Diagnosis of COVID-19 using CT scan images and deep learning techniques.,"Early diagnosis of the coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19) is essential for controlling this pandemic. COVID-19 has been spreading rapidly all over the world. There is no vaccine available for this virus yet. Fast and accurate COVID-19 screening is possible using computed tomography (CT) scan images. The deep learning techniques used in the proposed method is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN). Our manuscript focuses on differentiating the CT scan images of COVID-19 and non-COVID 19 CT using different deep learning techniques. A self-developed model named CTnet-10 was designed for the COVID-19 diagnosis, having an accuracy of 82.1%. Also, other models that we tested are DenseNet-169, VGG-16, ResNet-50, InceptionV3, and VGG-19. The VGG-19 proved to be superior with an accuracy of 94.52% as compared to all other deep learning models. Automated diagnosis of COVID-19 from the CT scan pictures can be used by the doctors as a quick and efficient method for COVID-19 screening.","Vruddhi Shah,Rinkal Keniya,Akanksha Shridharani,Manav Punjabi,Jainam Shah,Ninad Mehendale",Emergency Radiology,2021

It is important to develop multiple approaches for timely and accurate detection of COVID-19 and its variants. Deep learning techniques are well proved for their efficiency in providing solutions to many social and economic problems. However, the transparency of the reasoning process of a deep learning model related to a high stake decision is a necessity. In this work, we propose an interpretable deep learning model Ps-ProtoPNet to detect COVID-19 from the medical images. Ps-ProtoPNet classifies the images by recognizing the objects rather than their background in the images. We demonstrate our model on the dataset of the chest CT-scan images. The highest accuracy that our model achieves is 99.29%.","Gurmail Singh,Gurmail Singh,Gurmail Singh,Kin-Choong Yow",Diagnostics,2021

In this paper, we proposed deep learning based approach to recognize the Covid-19 infection from the CT-scans. Our approach consists of two main stages. In the first stage, we trained deep learning architectures with Multi-task strategy for Slice-Level classification. In the second stage, we used the previous trained models with XG-boost classifier to classify the whole CT-scan into Normal, Covid-19 or Cap class. The evaluation of our approach achieved promising results on the validation data of SPGC-COVID dataset. In more details, our approach achieved 87.75% as overall accuracy and 96.36%, 52.63% and 95.83% sensitivities for Covid-19, Cap and Normal, respectively. From other hand, our approach achieved the fifth place on the three test datasets of SPGC on COVID-19 challenge where our approach achieved the best result for Covid-19 sensitivity.","Fares Bougourzi,Riccardo Contino,Cosimo Distante,Cosimo Distante,Abdelmalik Taleb-Ahmed","ICASSP 2021 - 2021 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)",2021

10.1016/j.bspc.2021.102588,33821166,,A Fully Automated Deep Learning-based Network For Detecting COVID-19 from a New And Large Lung CT Scan Dataset.,"This paper aims to propose a high-speed and accurate fully-automated method to detect COVID-19 from the patient's chest CT scan images. We introduce a new dataset that contains 48260 CT scan images from 282 normal persons and 15589 images from 95 patients with COVID-19 infections. At the first stage, this system runs our proposed image processing algorithm that analyzes the view of the lung to discard those CT images that inside the lung is not properly visible in them. This action helps to reduce the processing time and false detections. At the next stage, we introduce a novel architecture for improving the classification accuracy of convolutional networks on images containing small important objects. Our architecture applies a new feature pyramid network designed for classification problems to the ResNet50V2 model so the model becomes able to investigate different resolutions of the image and do not lose the data of small objects. As the infections of COVID-19 exist in various scales, especially many of them are tiny, using our method helps to increase the classification performance remarkably. After running these two phases, the system determines the condition of the patient using a selected threshold. We are the first to evaluate our system in two different ways on Xception, ResNet50V2, and our model. In the single image classification stage, our model achieved 98.49% accuracy on more than 7996 test images. At the patient condition identification phase, the system correctly identified almost 234 of 245 patients with high speed.","Mohammad Rahimzadeh,Abolfazl Attar,Seyed Mohammad Sakhaei",Biomedical Signal Processing and Control,2021

To this end, we adopt advanced deep network architectures and propose a transfer learning strategy using custom-sized input tailored for each deep architecture to achieve the best performance. We conduct extensive sets of experiments on two CT image datasets, namely the SARS-CoV-2 CT-scan and the COVID19-CT.

We collect 58 clinical and biological variables, and chest CT scan data, from 1003 coronavirus-infected patients from two French hospitals. We train a deep learning model based on CT scans to predict severity. We then construct the multimodal AI-severity score that includes 5 clinical and biological variables (age, sex, oxygenation, urea, platelet) in addition to the deep learning model. We show that neural network analysis of CT-scans brings unique prognosis information, although it is correlated with other markers of severity (oxygenation, LDH, and CRP) explaining the measurable but limited 0.03 increase of AUC obtained when adding CT-scan information to clinical variables. Here, we show that when comparing AI-severity with 11 existing severity scores, we find significantly improved prognosis performance; AI-severity can therefore rapidly become a reference scoring approach. The SARS-COV-2 pandemic has put pressure on intensive care units, so that predicting severe deterioration early is a priority.

The detection of COVID-19 using artificial intelligence techniques and especially deep learning will help to detect this virus in early stages which will reflect in increasing the opportunities of fast recovery of patients worldwide. This will lead to release the pressure off the healthcare system around the world. In this research, classical data augmentation techniques along with Conditional Generative Adversarial Nets (CGAN) based on a deep transfer learning model for COVID-19 detection in chest CT scan images will be presented. The limited benchmark datasets for COVID-19 especially in chest CT images are the main motivation of this research. The main idea is to collect all the possible images for COVID-19 that exists until the very writing of this research and use the classical data augmentations along with CGAN to generate more images to help in the detection of the COVID-19. In this study, five different deep convolutional neural network-based models (AlexNet, VGGNet16, VGGNet19, GoogleNet, and ResNet50) have been selected for the investigation to detect the Coronavirus-infected patient using chest CT radiographs digital images.

The control of epidemics such as COVID-19 can be managed effectively by exploiting edge computation through the 5G wireless connectivity network. The implementation of a hierarchical edge computing system provides many advantages, such as low latency, scalability, and the protection of application and training model data, enabling COVID-19 to be evaluated by a dependable local edge server. In addition, many deep learning (DL) algorithms suffer from two crucial disadvantages: first, training requires a large COVID-19 dataset consisting of various aspects, which will pose challenges for local councils; second, to acknowledge the outcome, the findings of deep learning require ethical acceptance and clarification by the health care sector, as well as other contributors. In this article, we propose a B5G framework that utilizes the 5G network's low-latency, high-bandwidth functionality to detect COVID-19 using chest X-ray or CT scan images, and to develop a mass surveillance system to monitor social distancing, mask wearing, and body temperature. Three DL models, ResNet50, Deep tree, and Inception v3, are investigated in the proposed framework. Furthermore, blockchain technology is also used to ensure the security of healthcare data.","M.

Previous studies have proven that deep learning algorithms can be utilized to aid in the diagnosis of patients with potential COVID-19 infection. However, the accuracy of current COVID-19 recognition models is relatively low. Motivated by this fact, we propose three deep learning architectures, F-EDNC, FC-EDNC, and O-EDNC, to quickly and accurately detect COVID-19 infections from chest computed tomography (CT) images. Sixteen deep learning neural networks have been modified and trained to recognize COVID-19 patients using transfer learning and 2458 CT chest images. The proposed EDNC has then been developed using three of sixteen modified pre-trained models to improve the performance of COVID-19 recognition. The results suggested that the F-EDNC method significantly enhanced the recognition of COVID-19 infections with 97.75% accuracy, followed by FC-EDNC and O-EDNC (97.55% and 96.12%, respectively), which is superior to most of the current COVID-19 recognition models. Furthermore, a localhost web application has been built that enables users to easily upload their chest CT scans and obtain their COVID-19 results automatically.

10.1016/j.compbiomed.2022.105461,,,A privacy-aware method for COVID-19 detection in chest CT images using lightweight deep conventional neural network and blockchain,"With the global spread of the COVID-19 epidemic, a reliable method is required for identifying COVID-19 victims. The biggest issue in detecting the virus is a lack of testing kits that are both reliable and affordable. Due to the virus's rapid dissemination, medical professionals have trouble finding positive patients. However, the next real-life issue is sharing data with hospitals around the world while considering the organizations' privacy concerns. The primary worries for training a global Deep Learning (DL) model are creating a collaborative platform and personal confidentiality. Another challenge is exchanging data with health care institutions while protecting the organizations' confidentiality. The primary concerns for training a universal DL model are creating a collaborative platform and preserving privacy. This paper provides a model that receives a small quantity of data from various sources, like organizations or sections of hospitals, and trains a global DL model utilizing blockchain-based Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). In addition, we use the Transfer Learning (TL) technique to initialize layers rather than initialize randomly and discover which layers should be removed before selection. Besides, the blockchain system verifies the data, and the DL method trains the model globally while keeping the institution's confidentiality. Furthermore, we gather the actual and novel COVID-19 patients. Finally, we run extensive experiments utilizing Python and its libraries, such as Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow, to assess the proposed method.

We first propose a convolutional neural network architecture to extract features from CT images, and then optimize the hyperparameters of the network using a tree Parzen estimator to choose the best parameters. Following this, we apply a selection of features using a genetic algorithm. Finally, classification is performed using four classifiers with different approaches.

To this end, recent research often uses medical imaging combined with machine vision methods to diagnose COVID-19. However, the scarcity of medical images and the inherent differences in existing datasets that arise from different medical imaging tools, methods, and specialists may affect the generalization of machine learning-based methods. Also, most of these methods are trained and tested on the same dataset, reducing the generalizability and causing low reliability of the obtained model in real-world applications. This paper introduces an adversarial deep domain adaptation-based approach for diagnosing COVID-19 from lung CT scan images, termed ADA-COVID. Domain adaptation-based training process receives multiple datasets with different input domains to generate domain-invariant representations for medical images. Also, due to the excessive structural similarity of medical images compared to other image data in machine vision tasks, we use the triplet loss function to generate similar representations for samples of the same class (infected cases). The performance of ADA-COVID is evaluated and compared with other state-of-the-art COVID-19 diagnosis algorithms. The obtained results indicate that ADA-COVID achieves classification improvements of at least 3%, 20%, 20%, and 11% in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, respectively, compared to the best results of competitors, even without directly training on the same data.

This disease is diagnosed using radiological images taken with the help of basic scanning methods besides the test kits for Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). Automatic analysis of chest Computed Tomography (CT) images that are based on image processing technology plays an important role in combating this infectious disease.    Material and methods  In this paper, a new Multiple Kernels-ELM-based Deep Neural Network (MKs-ELM-DNN) method is proposed for the detection of novel coronavirus disease - also known as COVID-19, through chest CT scanning images. In the model proposed, deep features are extracted from CT scan images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). For this purpose, pre-trained CNN-based DenseNet201 architecture, which is based on the transfer learning approach is used. Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) classifier based on different activation methods is used to calculate the architecture's performance. Lastly, the final class label is determined using the majority voting method for prediction of the results obtained from each architecture based on ReLU-ELM, PReLU-ELM, and TanhReLU-ELM.    Results  In experimental works, a public dataset containing COVID-19 and Non-COVID-19 classes was used to verify the validity of the MKs-ELM-DNN model proposed. According to the results obtained, the accuracy score was obtained as 98.36% using the MKs-ELM-DNN model. The results have demonstrated that, when compared, the MKs-ELM-DNN model proposed is proven to be more successful than the state-of-the-art algorithms and previous studies.

,,,Resetting the baseline: CT-based COVID-19 diagnosis with Deep Transfer Learning is not as accurate as widely thought.,"Deep learning is gaining instant popularity in computer aided diagnosis of COVID-19. Due to the high sensitivity of Computed Tomography (CT) to this disease, CT-based COVID-19 detection with visual models is currently at the forefront of medical imaging research. Outcomes published in this direction are frequently claiming highly accurate detection under deep transfer learning. This is leading medical technologists to believe that deep transfer learning is the mainstream solution for the problem. However, our critical analysis of the literature reveals an alarming performance disparity between different published results. Hence, we conduct a systematic thorough investigation to analyze the effectiveness of deep transfer learning for COVID-19 detection with CT images. Exploring 14 state-of-the-art visual models with over 200 model training sessions, we conclusively establish that the published literature is frequently overestimating transfer learning performance for the problem, even in the prestigious scientific sources. The roots of overestimation trace back to inappropriate data curation. We also provide case studies that consider more realistic scenarios, and establish transparent baselines for the problem. We hope that our reproducible investigation will help in curbing hype-driven claims for the critical problem of COVID-19 diagnosis, and pave the way for a more transparent performance evaluation of techniques for CT-based COVID-19 detection.","Fouzia Altaf,Syed Islam,Naveed Akhtar",arXiv: Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition,2021

To fight against the spread of this virus, clinical image analysis of chest CT (computed tomography) images can play an important role for an accurate diagnostic. In the present work, a bi-modular hybrid model is proposed to detect COVID-19 from the chest CT images. In the first module, we have used a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to extract features from the chest CT images. In the second module, we have used a bi-stage feature selection (FS) approach to find out the most relevant features for the prediction of COVID and non-COVID cases from the chest CT images. At the first stage of FS, we have applied a guided FS methodology by employing two filter methods: Mutual Information (MI) and Relief-F, for the initial screening of the features obtained from the CNN model. In the second stage, Dragonfly algorithm (DA) has been used for the further selection of most relevant features. The final feature set has been used for the classification of the COVID-19 and non-COVID chest CT images using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The proposed model has been tested on two open-access datasets: SARS-CoV-2 CT images and COVID-CT datasets and the model shows substantial prediction rates of 98.39% and 90.0% on the said datasets respectively.

,,,Automatic Diagnosis of COVID-19 from CT Images using CycleGAN and Transfer Learning,"The outbreak of the corona virus disease (COVID-19) has changed the lives of most people on Earth. Given the high prevalence of this disease, its correct diagnosis in order to quarantine patients is of the utmost importance in steps of fighting this pandemic. Among the various modalities used for diagnosis, medical imaging, especially computed tomography (CT) imaging, has been the focus of many previous studies due to its accuracy and availability. In addition, automation of diagnostic methods can be of great help to physicians. In this paper, a method based on pre-trained deep neural networks is presented, which, by taking advantage of a cyclic generative adversarial net (CycleGAN) model for data augmentation, has reached state-of-the-art performance for the task at hand, i.e., 99.60% accuracy. Also, in order to evaluate the method, a dataset containing 3163 images from 189 patients has been collected and labeled by physicians. Unlike prior datasets, normal data have been collected from people suspected of having COVID-19 disease and not from data from other diseases, and this database is made available publicly.","Navid Ghassemi,Afshin Shoeibi,Marjane Khodatars,Jonathan Heras,JÃ³nathan Heras,Alireza Rahimi,Assef Zare,Ram Bilas Pachori,Ram Bilas Pachori,Ram Bilas Pachori,Ram Bilas Pachori,J.

Disease extent on CT has been reported to influence prognosis. Purpose To create a large publicly available dataset and assess the diagnostic and prognostic value of CT in COVID-19 pneumonia. Materials and Methods This multicenter observational retrospective cohort study (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04355507) involved 20 French university hospitals. Eligible subjects presented at the emergency departments of the hospitals involved between March 1st and April 30th, 2020 and underwent both thoracic CT and RT-PCR for suspected COVID-19 pneumonia. CT images were read blinded to initial reports, RT-PCR, demographic characteristics, clinical symptoms, and outcome. Readers classified CT scans as positive or negative for COVID-19, based on criteria published by the French Society of Radiology. Multivariable logistic regression was used to develop a model predicting severe outcome (intubation or death) at 1-month follow-up in subjects positive for both RT-PCR and CT, using clinical and radiological features. Results Of 10,930 subjects screened for eligibility, 10,735 (median age 65 years, interquartile range, 51-77 years; 6,147 men) were included and 6,448 (60.0%) had a positive RT-PCR result. With RT-PCR as reference, the sensitivity and specificity and CT were 80.2% (95%CI: 79.3, 81.2) and 79.7% (95%CI: 78.5, 80.9), respectively with strong agreement between junior and senior radiologists (Gwet's AC1 coefficient: 0.79) Of all the variables analysed, the extent of pneumonia on CT (OR 3.25, 95%CI: 2.71, 3.89) was the best predictor of severe outcome at one month. A score based solely on clinical variables predicted a severe outcome with an AUC of 0.64 (95%CI: 0.62, 0.66), improving to 0.69 (95%CI: 0.6, 0.71) when it also included the extent of pneumonia and coronary calcium score on CT. Conclusion Using pre-defined criteria, CT reading is not influenced by reader's experience and helps predict the outcome at one month. Published under a CC BY 4.0 license.

10.1109/tmi.2020.2995508,32730212,,Dual-Sampling Attention Network for Diagnosis of COVID-19 From Community Acquired Pneumonia,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is rapidly spreading all over the world, and has infected more than 1,436,000 people in more than 200 countries and territories as of April 9, 2020. Detecting COVID-19 at early stage is essential to deliver proper healthcare to the patients and also to protect the uninfected population. To this end, we develop a dual-sampling attention network to automatically diagnose COVID-19 from the community acquired pneumonia (CAP) in chest computed tomography (CT). In particular, we propose a novel online attention module with a 3D convolutional network (CNN) to focus on the infection regions in lungs when making decisions of diagnoses. Note that there exists imbalanced distribution of the sizes of the infection regions between COVID-19 and CAP, partially due to fast progress of COVID-19 after symptom onset. Therefore, we develop a dual-sampling strategy to mitigate the imbalanced learning. Our method is evaluated (to our best knowledge) upon the largest multi-center CT data for COVID-19 from 8 hospitals. In the training-validation stage, we collect 2186 CT scans from 1588 patients for a 5-fold cross-validation. In the testing stage, we employ another independent large-scale testing dataset including 2796 CT scans from 2057 patients. Results show that our algorithm can identify the COVID-19 images with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) value of 0.944, accuracy of 87.5%, sensitivity of 86.9%, specificity of 90.1%, and F1-score of 82.0%. With this performance, the proposed algorithm could potentially aid radiologists with COVID-19 diagnosis from CAP, especially in the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak.","Xi Ouyang,Jiayu Huo,Liming Xia,Fei Shan,Fei Shan,Jun Liu,Jun Liu,Jun Liu,Jun Liu,Jun Liu,Jun Liu,Zhanhao Mo,Fuhua Yan,Fuhua Yan,Fuhua Yan,Fuhua Yan,Zhongxiang Ding,Qi Yang,Qi Yang,Qi Yang,Bin Song,Bin Song,Feng Shi,Huan Yuan,Ying Wei,Xiaohuan Cao,Yaozong Gao,Dijia Wu,Qian Wang,Qian Wang,Qian Wang,Dinggang Shen",IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging,2020
10.1007/s00330-020-06956-w,32462445,,Any unique image biomarkers associated with COVID-19?,"OBJECTIVE: To define the uniqueness of chest CT infiltrative features associated with COVID-19 image characteristics as potential diagnostic biomarkers. METHODS: We retrospectively collected chest CT exams including n = 498 on 151 unique patients RT-PCR positive for COVID-19 and n = 497 unique patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Both COVID-19 and CAP image sets were partitioned into three groups for training, validation, and testing respectively. In an attempt to discriminate COVID-19 from CAP, we developed several classifiers based on three-dimensional (3D) convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We also asked two experienced radiologists to visually interpret the testing set and discriminate COVID-19 from CAP. The classification performance of the computer algorithms and the radiologists was assessed using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, and the nonparametric approaches with multiplicity adjustments when necessary. RESULTS: One of the considered models showed non-trivial, but moderate diagnostic ability overall (AUC of 0.70 with 99% CI 0.56-0.85). This model allowed for the identification of 8-50% of CAP patients with only 2% of COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Professional or automated interpretation of CT exams has a moderately low ability to distinguish between COVID-19 and CAP cases. However, the automated image analysis is promising for targeted decision-making due to being able to accurately identify a sizable subsect of non-COVID-19 cases. KEY POINTS: â¢ Both human experts and artificial intelligent models were used to classify the CT scans. â¢ ROC analysis and the nonparametric approaches were used to analyze the performance of the radiologists and computer algorithms. â¢ Unique image features or patterns may not exist for reliably distinguishing all COVID-19 from CAP; however, there may be imaging markers that can identify a sizable subset of non-COVID-19 cases.","Jiantao Pu,Joseph K.

10.1016/j.irbm.2020.05.003,32837678,,Deep Transfer Learning Based Classification Model for COVID-19 Disease.,"Abstract   The COVID-19 infection is increasing at a rapid rate, with the availability of limited number of testing kits. Therefore, the development of COVID-19 testing kits is still an open area of research. Recently, many studies have shown that chest Computed Tomography(CT) images can be used for COVID-19 testing, as chest CT images show a bilateral change in COVID-19 infected patients. However, the classification of COVID-19 patients from chest CT images is not an easy task as predicting the bilateral change is defined as an ill-posed problem. Therefore, in this paper, a deep transfer learning technique is used to classify COVID-19 infected patients. Additionally, a top-2 smooth loss function with cost-sensitive attributes is also utilized to handle noisy and imbalanced COVID-19 dataset kind of problems. Experimental results reveal that the proposed deep transfer learning-based COVID-19 classification model provides efficient results as compared to the other supervised learning models.","Yadunath Pathak,Prashant Shukla,Akhilesh Tiwari,Shalini Stalin,S.

10.1016/j.patcog.2021.108071,34092815,,Lung Segmentation and Automatic Detection of COVID-19 Using Radiomic Features from Chest CT Images.,"This paper aims to develop an automatic method to segment pulmonary parenchyma in chest CT images and analyze texture features from the segmented pulmonary parenchyma regions to assist radiologists in COVID-19 diagnosis. A new segmentation method, which integrates a three-dimensional (3D) V-Net with a shape deformation module implemented using a spatial transform network (STN), was proposed to segment pulmonary parenchyma in chest CT images. The 3D V-Net was adopted to perform an end-to-end lung extraction while the deformation module was utilized to restrict the V-Net output according to the prior shape knowledge. The proposed segmentation method was validated against the manual annotation generated by experienced operators. The radiomic features measured from our segmentation results were further analyzed by sophisticated statistical models with high interpretability to discover significant independent features and detect COVID-19 infection. Experimental results demonstrated that compared with the manual annotation, the proposed segmentation method achieved a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.9796, a sensitivity of 0.9840, a specificity of 0.9954, and a mean surface distance error of 0.0318 mm. Furthermore, our COVID-19 classification model achieved an area under curve (AUC) of 0.9470, a sensitivity of 0.9500, and a specificity of 0.9270 when discriminating lung infection with COVID-19 from community-acquired pneumonia and healthy controls using statistically significant radiomic features. The significant features measured from our segmentation results agreed well with those from the manual annotation. Our approach has great promise for clinical use in facilitating automatic diagnosis of COVID-19 infection on chest CT images.","Chen Zhao,Yan Xu,Zhuo He,Jinshan Tang,Yijun Zhang,Jungang Han,Yuxin Shi,Weihua Zhou",Pattern Recognition,2021

Beside clinical procedures and treatments, since Artificial Intelligence (AI) promises a new paradigm for healthcare, several different AI tools that are built upon Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are employed for analyzing data and decision-making processes. This means that AI-driven tools help identify COVID-19 outbreaks as well as forecast their nature of spread across the globe. However, unlike other healthcare issues, for COVID-19, to detect COVID-19, AI-driven tools are expected to have active learning-based cross-population train/test models that employs multitudinal and multimodal data, which is the primary purpose of the paper.",K.

For this, we mainly consider AI-driven tools that employ two different types of image data, namely chest Computed Tomography (CT) and X-ray. We elaborate on their strengths and weaknesses by taking the following important factors into account: i) dataset size; ii) model fitting criteria (over-fitting and under-fitting); iii) transfer learning in the deep learning era; and iv) data augmentation. Medical imaging tools do not explicitly analyze model fitting. Also, using transfer learning, with fewer data, one could possibly build Covid-19 deep learning model but they are limited to education and training. We observe that, in both image modalities, neither the dataset size nor does data augmentation work well for Covid-19 screening purposes because a large dataset does not guarantee all possible Covid-19 manifestations and data augmentation does not create new Covid-19 cases.","K.

Nevertheless, RNA amplification techniques have been the gold standard among other diagnostic methods for monitoring clinical samples for the presence of the virus. In the current paper, we review the shortcomings and strengths of RT-PCR (real-time polymerase chain reaction) techniques for diagnosis of coronavirus disease (COVID)-19. We address the repercussions of false-negative and false-positive rates encountered in the test, summarize approaches to improve the overall sensitivity of this method. We discuss the barriers to the widespread use of the RT-PCR test, and some technical advances, such as RT-LAMP (reverse-transcriptase-loop mediated isothermal amplification). We also address how other molecular techniques, such as immunodiagnostic tests can be used to avoid incorrect interpretation of RT-PCR tests.","Manoucher Teymouri,Samaneh Mollazadeh,Hamed Mortazavi,Zari Naderi Ghale-noie,Vahideh Keyvani,Farzaneh Aghababaei,Michael R.
